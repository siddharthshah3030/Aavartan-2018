  round1: "In this round, basically your imagination is judged based on concept of mirror and its properties like reflection, refraction, total internal reflection etc. Description: Each team shall be given 5min and provided 8 small pieces of mirror of size 8cm*8cm. The team is given a source of laser beam and a target and is asked to make a mirror maze, or an arrangement out of their imagination using concepts of multiple reflections and strike the target with laser beam within the given time.",
   round2: "Khet is a chess-like abstract strategy board game using lasers. Teams take turns moving Egyptian-themed pieces around the playing field, firing their laser after each move.<br>Each team starts the game with a few playing pieces, arranged in a pre-defined configuration and a laser. The pieces in the game are:<br><br>Sphinx :<br>The Sphinxes hold the lasers. They may not move (each team's is located at their closest right-hand corner) but may be rotated in place so as to fire down the rank instead of the file. A Sphinx is unaffected by laser fire, whether the opponent's or its own reflected back upon itself. <br>Pharaoh :<br>The Pharaoh is the most important piece for each side, similar to a king in chess. If it is hit with a laser, it is destroyed and its owner loses the game. <br>Scarab :<br>Scarabs consist primarily of large, dual-sided mirrors. They reflect a laser coming in from any direction and thus cannot be eliminated from the board. <br>Pyramid :<br>Pyramids have a single diagonal mirror, and form the primary mechanism for directing the path of the laser. They are vulnerable to a hit from two of the four sides. <br>Obelisk :<br>Large pillars with no mirrored sides, these are vulnerable to attack from any direction, and therefore useful mostly as an emergency sacrifice to protect another piece (such as the Pharaoh). <br>Anubis :<br>Anubis has the advantage that, despite still being un-mirrored, they are not affected by a laser strike on the front; they must be hit on the sides or rear in order to be eliminated.<br>",

The Sphinx can be rotated to point the laser down either the first column or the first row and is only optional. If a team chooses to rotate the Sphinx as his/her turn, it must be rotated before the head is pushed and the laser is fired<br>3. A turn consists of moving any one piece one step in any direction (including diagonally) or of rotating a piece a quarter turn (90 degrees) in either direction without changing squares. A piece cannot be moved and rotated on the same turn or rotated more than a quarter twist on one turn.<br>4. No red piece, including a Scarab, can move into any square containing a silvermark. No silver piece, including a Scarab, can move into any square containing a redmark that are located along portions of the edges of the board.<br>5. Except for the Scarab, no piece can move into a square occupied by another piece of either colour. <br>6. The Scarab can swap places with an adjacent Pyramid or Anubis, but not with a Pharaoh or another Scarab piece. Neither piece rotates during the swap. <br>7. If the laser beam stops on a non-mirrored surface of a Pyramid that piece is removed from the board.<br>8. If the laser beam stops on the front side of an Anubis piece, the Anubis is not removed from the board and the turn is over—this piece is impervious to a hit on its front. If the laser beam strikes a side or back of an Anubis, that piece is removed from the board.<br>9. The laser is fired only once at the end of a team’s turn. The turn is over whether or not a piece is hit. Teams may not test where the beam will go by firing the laser before completing their moves.<br>10. The game ends when a beam illuminates a Pharaoh. The winner is the team whose Pharaoh wasn’t hit. A team who illuminates his or her own Pharaoh is out of luck.",
