  description: "",
  round1: "In this round, basically your imagination is judged based on concept of mirror and its properties like reflection, refraction, total internal reflection etc. Description: Each team shall be given 5min and provided 8 small pieces of mirror of size 8cm*8cm. The team is given a source of laser beam and a target and is asked to make a mirror maze, or an arrangement out of their imagination using concepts of multiple reflections and strike the target with laser beam within the given time.",
   round2: "Khet is a chess-like abstract strategy board game using lasers. Teams take turns moving Egyptian-themed pieces around the playing field, firing their laser after each move.<br>Each team starts the game with a few playing pieces, arranged in a pre-defined configuration and a laser. The pieces in the game are:<br><br>Sphinx :<br>The Sphinxes hold the lasers. They may not move (each team's is located at their closest right-hand corner) but may be rotated in place so as to fire down the rank instead of the file. A Sphinx is unaffected by laser fire, whether the opponent's or its own reflected back upon itself. <br>Pharaoh :<br>The Pharaoh is the most important piece for each side, similar to a king in chess. If it is hit with a laser, it is destroyed and its owner loses the game. <br>Scarab :<br>Scarabs consist primarily of large, dual-sided mirrors. They reflect a laser coming in from any direction and thus cannot be eliminated from the board. <br>Pyramid :<br>Pyramids have a single diagonal mirror, and form the primary mechanism for directing the path of the laser. They are vulnerable to a hit from two of the four sides. <br>Obelisk :<br>Large pillars with no mirrored sides, these are vulnerable to attack from any direction, and therefore useful mostly as an emergency sacrifice to protect another piece (such as the Pharaoh). <br>Anubis :<br>Anubis has the advantage that, despite still being un-mirrored, they are not affected by a laser strike on the front; they must be hit on the sides or rear in order to be eliminated.<br>",

The Sphinx can be rotated to point the laser down either the first column or the first row and is only optional. If a team chooses to rotate the Sphinx as his/her turn, it must be rotated before the head is pushed and the laser is fired<br>3. A turn consists of moving any one piece one step in any direction (including diagonally) or of rotating a piece a quarter turn (90 degrees) in either direction without changing squares. A piece cannot be moved and rotated on the same turn or rotated more than a quarter twist on one turn.<br>4. No red piece, including a Scarab, can move into any square containing a silvermark. No silver piece, including a Scarab, can move into any square containing a redmark that are located along portions of the edges of the board.<br>5. Except for the Scarab, no piece can move into a square occupied by another piece of either colour. <br>6. The Scarab can swap places with an adjacent Pyramid or Anubis, but not with a Pharaoh or another Scarab piece. Neither piece rotates during the swap. <br>7. If the laser beam stops on a non-mirrored surface of a Pyramid that piece is removed from the board.<br>8. If the laser beam stops on the front side of an Anubis piece, the Anubis is not removed from the board and the turn is over—this piece is impervious to a hit on its front. If the laser beam strikes a side or back of an Anubis, that piece is removed from the board.<br>9. The laser is fired only once at the end of a team’s turn. The turn is over whether or not a piece is hit. Teams may not test where the beam will go by firing the laser before completing their moves.<br>10. The game ends when a beam illuminates a Pharaoh. The winner is the team whose Pharaoh wasn’t hit. A team who illuminates his or her own Pharaoh is out of luck.",

   description: "<strong>Event name – KNOCKDOWN</strong><br>Here, the participants will have to participate in groups of 2. Each one of them will have a rope tied around his abdomen and to the other end of the rope will be attached a small piece of wood which they have to swing themselves and with that they have to knock down several plastic cups which would be placed on the ground.

The table tops would be covered by handmade obstacles. The tables would be slightly tilted or inclined. The participant has to blow the ball with air and let it pass through the obstacles to the finishing line. However, during the whole process the ball should not touch the boundary of the lower end of the tilted table. If the ball touches the lower boundary then the ball would be disqualified and participant would have to start with the new ball again from the starting line.<br><strong>Event name - Tyre shot</strong><br>Here the participants would have to participate in groups of two. One participant will hold the tyre/ring structure up in the air with his hands and the other one would be standing at a distance from him with few tennis balls in his hands. This person has to make the balls go through the tyre/ring by aiming the tennis balls by leaning and throwing it between his legs. The team which gets the tennis ball passed through the tyre/ring first will be the winner.<br><strong>Event Name - Word jumble</strong><br>Here, different words would be kept in the chits on the tables. The team members have to take 5 chits at a time. If the team doesn’t gets any word, they had to take 5 extra chits. The team which forms a valid word fastest from its own selected chits will be declared the winner.<br><strong>Event Name - Water Blow</strong></br>Here, 5-6 plastic cups or normal cups would be placed in a line close to each other, just next to each other. Each one of them would be filled with water. The participant would have to blow the ball to the last cup filled with water. If the ball falls down, The last cup in which the ball was properly placed has to be the place of continuation of the game. The participant which finishes by blowing the ball upto the last cup filled with water will be declared the winner.",
